"Despair and Deception, Love’s ugly little twins came a-knocking on my door, and I let them in. Darling, you’re the punishment for all my former sins, and I let love in. The door opened just a crack, but Love was shrewd and bold. My life flashed before my eyes, a horror to behold, a life-sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole, and I let love in. Well, I’ve been bound and gagged, terrorized, castrated, and lobotomized, but never has my tormentor come in such a cunning disguise, and I let love in. O Lord, tell me what I’ve done, please don’t leave me here on my own. Where are my friends? My friends are gone. So if you’re sitting all alone and hear a-knocking at your door, and the air of promises, well buddy, you’ve been warned. Far worse to be Love’s lover than the lover that Love has scorned, and I let love in."

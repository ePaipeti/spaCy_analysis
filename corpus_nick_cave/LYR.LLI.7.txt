"I know you’ve hear it all before
But I’m sorry for this three year war
For the setting up of camps
 and wire and trenches
I’m sorry for the other night
I know sorry it don’t make it right
I’m sorry for things I can’t even mention

I’m sorry sorry sorry, sorry
I’m sitting feeling sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I’m sorry sorry sorry, sorry
I’m feeling very sorry in the Thirsty Dog

You keep nailing me back into my box
I’m sorry I keep popping back up
With my crazy mouth 
and jangling jester’s cap
I’m sorry I ever wrote that book
I’m sorry about the way I look
But there ain’t a lot that
 I can do about that

I’m sorry about the hospital
Some things are unforgivable
Some things simply cannot be forgiven
I was not equipped to know how to care
And on the occasions I came up for air
I saw my life and wondered 
what the hell I had been living

I’m sorry about all your friends
I hope they’ll speak to me again
I said before I’d pay for all the damage
I’m sorry it’s just rotten luck
I’m sorry I’ve forgotten how to fuck
It’s just that I think my heart 
and soul are kind of famished

Forgive me, darling but don’t worry
Love is always having to
 say you’re sorry
And I am, from my head
 down to my shoes
I’m sorry that I’m always pissed
I’m sorry that I exist
And when I look into your eyes
I can see you’re sorry too

I’m sorry sorry sorry, sorry
I’m sitting feeling sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I’m sorry sorry sorry, sorry
I’m feeling very sorry in the Thirsty Dog"
